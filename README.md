# Autonomous German Vocabulary Word Frequency List - Learn What German Words to Learn with Twitch Streams

## Background:

Recently I set on a fun challenge of learning enough German so I could read Kafka in its original text; but what fun is language learning without consuming media?

I enjoy watching a German livesteamer on Twitch -- even if I can't understand anything he is saying. This project is an autonomously updating database that collects all Twitch chat messages from https://www.twitch.tv/kev1ntv, and then the database is parsed and a word frequency list is created.

By analyzing thousands of messages, I can learn what German vocabulary words I should learn so I can understand Kev1ntv's Twitch chat: updated automatically with the use of an AWS Lambda function.

## Visualizations:
**TOP 30 MOST USED WORDS:**

**TOP 30 ACTIVE TWITCH VIEWERS:**

As of 10:48AM 4/18/2021, these graphs were created from 1591 rows of data collected over the previous three days.

## Project Overview:

This project utilizes the Twitch API to create a function and check if the Twitch channel https://www.twitch.tv/kev1ntv is online. If it isn't online, then the script abandons the proccess and exits.

If the channel is online, then the script connects to the Twitch IRC channel utilizing Socket, creating a function to read each message and user in live time.

All messages are sent to a PostgreSQL RDS hosted on AWS:

The Python script is then hosted on an AWS Lambda function, scheduled to execute the script every 5 minutes; so, data is collected from Kev1ntv's livestream autonomously if he is online.

Each time the Lambda function is executed, it stores data into the PostgreSQL DB and into a DynamoDB for backup.

## Future of This Project:

I still want to add a lot to this project! Eventually, I plan on containerizing the scripts, and placing those containers into an AWS EC2 instance. I will then use Apache Airflow to schedule those scripts to run instead of using a Lambda function. Here are some pictures of my "office" setup while I worked through this project:

So, I clearly was a bit confused as I worked through this project! There is still a lot of things I want to do with it, as listed below. My plan is to add these changes by the end of the summer semester:

I had such a fun time making the first version of this project, and even though I spent hours frustratedly googling things, the satisfaction of making something made everything so worth it. I loved learning about basic networking with sockets, IRC, interacting with APIs, AWS, and PostgreSQL. 

This project will update frequently! I'm excited to improve it!
